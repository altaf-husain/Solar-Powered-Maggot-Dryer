# solar-powered-maggot-dryer
"Experimental study of a cylindrical type solar powered maggot dryer using a flat mirror concentrator" a high school project that I carried out during the Covid-19 outbreak with my colleague Fadlan in the 2020 National Science Festival competition which was held online by the Bogor Agricultural Institute, the competition division I participated in the Stem Young Research Award where participants were asked to create an innovation in the form of a prototype. Our team representing Madrasah Aliyah Negeri 5 Bogor got 4th place

short description of the project
Dried maggots are widely used as animal feed. To obtain them, they need to go through a proper drying process. Drying them in the oven causes the maggots to burn easily and causes danger to livestock. Therefore, this tool provides a solution for drying maggots that is cheap and fast because it uses a cylindrical aluminum plate layer and able to reflect sunlight so that more hot light enters, making the temperature in the room higher. The maximum temperature produced can reach 70 degrees Celsius

I designed the prototype using the Prisma 3D application on a smartphone
