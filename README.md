# solar-powered-maggot-dryer
"Experimental study of a cylindrical type solar powered maggot dryer using a flat mirror concentrator" a high school project that I carried out during the Covid-19 outbreak with my colleague Fadlan in the 2020 National Science Festival competition which was held online by the Bogor Agricultural Institute, the competition division I participated in the Stem Young Research Award where participants were asked to create an innovation in the form of a prototype. Our team representing Madrasah Aliyah Negeri 5 Bogor got 4th place

short description of the project
Dried maggots are widely used as animal feed. To obtain them, they need to go through a proper drying process. Drying them in the oven causes the maggots to burn easily and causes danger to livestock. Therefore, this tool provides a solution for drying maggots that is cheap and fast because it uses a cylindrical aluminum plate layer and able to reflect sunlight so that more hot light enters, making the temperature in the room higher
